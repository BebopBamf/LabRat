# Lab Rat

Historically speaking, if we think of the generic format of a 'coding lab',
everyone has a preset amount of challenges or excercises to complete. Students
grab a seat and an empty computer and attempt those challenges. Additionally,
there might be a moment where the tutor gives a presentation on coding style and
quality.

Attendance is also historically low in these labs. There is no incentive to
attend a lab that can easily be completed at home.

On the other end or the tutors end, at the start of the semester it is hard to
answer questions and understand the areas of struggle of all 40 students in a
lab. There is no active feedback when students are completing activities, you
don't know where they are at.

## Lab Rat Goals

I want to attempt to build a platform for live and interactive learning where

- Students are not obligated to use, they can do traditional style labs if they
  prefer, the platform should be a place of choice.
- Students should be able to interact and ask questions, both privately and
  publicly
- There should be the ability to join classrooms or sessions like in Kahoot 
- There should be some sort of way to do live quizzes and get some interactive
  activities in class, whether it be a link to a kahoot or an actual quiz
- There should be some sort of activity timer, with the ability to add time if
  the class goes over time.
- Ability for students to mark activities as completed, give feedback on
  activities and provide a time for when the activity was completed.
- Statistics on the completion rate of activities, some activity feedback etc.
